# Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains Deep Learning Projects for Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree program](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch). 

## Contents

* [Project 1:](https://github.com/dsinas/DL-Projects/tree/master/project-bikesharing) Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns **-** Implement a neural network in NumPy to predict bike rentals.

* [Project 2:](https://github.com/dsinas/DL-Projects/tree/master/project-dog-classification) Dog Breed Classifier **-** Build a convolutional neural network with PyTorch to classify any image (even an image of a face) as a specific dog breed.

* [Project 3:](https://github.com/dsinas/DL-Projects/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation) TV Script Generation **-** Build a recurrent neural network to generate new "fake" TV scripts using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons.

* [Project 4:](https://github.com/dsinas/DL-Projects/tree/master/project-face-generation) Face Generation **-** Define and train a DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) on a dataset of faces to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!
